--Q4.5
/*yes it did a good job*/

--Q4.6
/* SELECT s.name, s.fips, i.income
FROM states s
JOIN income i ON s.fips = i.fips
WHERE i.year = (SELECT MAX(year) FROM income)  -- assuming you want the latest year available
ORDER BY i.income DESC
LIMIT 1;
yes it should work*/

--Q4.7 
/*WITH population_va AS (
    SELECT year, population
    FROM population
    WHERE fips = '51'  -- FIPS code for Virginia
    ORDER BY year DESC
    LIMIT 6  -- We need 6 years to calculate 5 growth rates (previous year comparison)
)

Does not work yet, will need modification to work in my database*/
